Sweet corn, spicy crispy jalapeño, and zesty poblano combine for forkful after forkful of deliciousness, all with a cheesy, melty sauce so divine, you'll melt in its presence. Pasta has never felt so perfecto.",

The elegant, crisp flavors of pear, with that subtle sweetness, is made for merging with the funky strength of blue cheese. Not to mention, the sweet caramelized onions and the peppery arugula… our perfect pairing has multiplied into a fantastic foursome of flavor. And adding in the crunchy almonds… well, math was never our strong suit; making great meals (and word puns) that you'll enjoy is.",

Thus ends the dictionary portion of this meal description. Onto the flavors: peppers, onion, garlic, pesto, tomatoes… and delightful, rich delightful, rich tortellini mixed right in. Nothing fancy, nothing overwhelming, just plain delicious.",
                "When Mom used to say “eat your vegetables,” it used to inspire waves of moans, groans, and hiding various green things in napkins. (We hope that asparagus isn't still balled up in there!) But there would be no objection to vegetables done this way, covered in a flaky, buttery biscuit with the secret to a lot of great vegetables: cheese, cheese, and more cheese. Mom won't need to say anything now: These vegetables will fly off the plate, into your mouth, and then the recipe into your heart. (That asparagus from 1987 is long gone, right?)",

This marriage of flavors and concepts (not to mention Mexico and Italy) is made in flavor heaven, with spicy jalapeño and sweet corn contrasting with crispy tortillas and fresh cilantro. Dreams, heaven, divine… are we overselling it a bit? We think not; take one taste and be transported. Tip: Easier way to mince cilantro? Gather them all in one hand and lay on the cutting board. Use your knife in a rocking motion to cut, then turn 90 degrees and repeat until the herbs are properly minced!",

Let us blow your mind further with this sesame noodle and broccoli dish. Noodles are tossed with a dressing that includes sweet teriyaki glaze and spicy Sriracha, then topped with roasted vegetables. Impress with trivia and taste thanks to this calorie-conscious “teriyaki” dinner. Tip: Best way to remove ribs and seeds from a red bell pepper? Cut off top and bottom of pepper, then either carefully cut or tear out the seed portion.",
                "We've offered Impossible burger as a customize-it option before, but we're as pleased as plant-based punch to be offering it to you as its own meal. And what a meal! A sesame slaw, full of flavor and crunch topping the burger with perfectly sweet teriyaki. We've also got fries on the side, of course, but these spuds are seasoned with special furikake seasoning. Everything about this meal is special, and it proves that delicious fake meat is absolutely not impossible.",
                "Spinach and artichoke is the basis of many a delicious dip, and now is the delicious basis for this creamy risotto. The fresh spinach and the briny artichokes (toasted!) combine with a hint of bright lemon to make this risotto sparkle and sing. What other appetizers will make great inspiration for us? Keep ordering and see.",
                "The tart brightness of lemon, the herbaceous Christmas tree delight of rosemary, sweet butternut, and earthy mushrooms all come together in lasagna skillet form, with this classic veggie stunner. And does this skillet have gooey mozzarella cheese? Oh does it ever!",
                "Step off the beaten path here with a meal that brings together three distinct and wonderful things: Brussels sprouts turned into fritters and fried to crunchy, salty, truly finger-licking perfection, sweet orange and spicy pepper flakes combining to form a sweet spicy sauce, and a bok choy rice that brings together starchy goodness and fresh bok choy. That's one long sentence to describe one great meal, but the flavors are worth every word.",

The sweet potato, firm outside and tender inside, living up to its name by lending a sweet touch to the proceedings. Slightly spicy poblano and sweet corn are obvious sunshine and lazy days ingredients… but the sour cream, guacamole, and tortillas on top? Our bowl is already clean: Summer soups sooth so splendidly. Tip: Having trouble cutting that wobbly sweet potato? Trim off 1/4" + "along its length and cut that section into 1/2" + "dice. Turn sweet potato onto its flat side. You now have a flat base to work from while you dice remaining sweet potato.",

Well, dinner, as right after reading this you'll be putting this meal in your basket for sure. But to elaborate further, teriyaki and pineapple provide a one-two huli huli punch that pairs with the tofu like nothing else. Want to hear more? It's easy-peasy to make and quick to come together. Mic. Dropped.",
                "We've never steered you wrong with a bowl of comfort pasta before, and this guy is not only comforting… he's interesting! Sweet soft butternut and buttery hard walnuts are both giving a slight dash of spices with Cajun seasoning, then added to a pasta with a rich Alfredo sauce and tangy goat cheese. We're steering you right yet again.",
                "Vegetarian isn't just rice bowl after rice bowl after tofu tacos after tofu tacos. (Our rice bowls and tofu tacos are delicious and amazing however, and you should order them every time!) Take this mighty mushroom sandwich, with melty cheese, fresh tomato, and that sweet, sweet BBQ sauce. Mix up your veggie world; you'll be surprised how delightful it is.",
                "Gnocchi are small Italian dumplings, whose name either comes from the Italian word for knot, or the Italian word for knuckle. (Both small things, but certainly not as delicious.) The denseness of gnocchi pairs so delightful with both the spring vegetables in this meal, and the creamy lemon sauce. It's rich, but light, filling, but not too heavy, a knot, but not a knuckle… ok, not so sure about that last one.",
                "Sriracha is everywhere: potato chips, fast food chains, probably an answer on Jeopardy at this point. But there is a reason behind the hipness and hype; Sriracha is a tasty and versatile hot sauce. Here, we combine the heat with garlic sesame sauce and use the resulting spoon-licking perfection to cook snap peas and sweet potato. Served with avocado, this meal is hip and happening, with just the right amount of spice. Tip: Having trouble cutting that wobbly sweet potato? Trim off 1/4" + "along its length and cut that section into 1/2" + "dice. Turn sweet potato onto its flat side. You now have a flat base to work from while you dice the remaining sweet potato.",
                "We love a good side of rice and beans, but you know what we love more? Stuffing Spanish-style rice and black beans into a roasted poblano, then topping it with melty cheese. Tomato salsa and sour cream on top just add to the things we love about this dish. Do you know what else we love? Our customers and that's why we've given this meal to you. (Too creepy?)",
                "We've combined tacos with many a world cuisine before, but we haven't yet brought tacos to the land of the rising sun. Not until now. Crispy fried tofu makes for a perfect morsel, topped with a fiery pineapple salsa that brings the heat and sweet in perfect balance. Add in that teriyaki glaze and you've got an East meets Southwest hand-held wonder that breaks the compass with ingenuity. Tip: Easiest way to remove jalapeño stems and seeds?

Instead, luxuriate in yummy pasta, tasty shrimp, and some classic staples of Greek food: salty feta, olives, and fresh oregano. Beware Greeks bearing shrimp? Don't ask us, it's all Greek (and delicious) to us.", "Hatch chiles get their name from the town of the same name in New Mexico, where the soil and growing conditions lead to their subtly spicy flavor. In this dish, the chile is mixed with flavorful ranch seasoning and tangy sour cream, making a sauce that bathes the chicken with pure deliciousness. The meal completes itself with sweet butternut squash with cheese and crunchy pepitas.", "Teriyaki salmon and mushroom fried rice can only come in paper cartons, right? With chopsticks and soy sauce packets, and maybe a few cookies? That's delicious, no doubt, but this is even better: you can make it at home and it only takes about 15 minutes. Take-out is terrific, but this is divine.", "Kefta is a form of Moroccan kebab made with ground beef or lamb and spices. We've left out the skewers, but kept in the flavor, with a fresh salad on the side. (And delicious, creamy tzatziki on top!)", "Is tikki masala British or Indian? The debate rages on, but it doesn't matter here, where all we want to deliver you is flavor and ease. Served with rice and peas on the bottom, and cooling sour cream on top, we leave the debates to the Oxford debate society. (Is that taking a side? Oh dear.)", "Few things are as decadent as creamy honey butter. Sitting atop succulent seared pork, and complemented with cheesy Parmesan broccoli, these flavors will surely elevate you into euphoria.", "The flavors of curry and coconut go together like Batman and Robin. They are flavor super heroes, they each have different, but complementary strengths, and they both wear capes. (That last one may be slightly less than true.) Which one is Batman and which one is Robin? We'll let you decide, since this meal obviously goes together with your future dinner plans.", "Name two better flavors out there than tangy BBQ and ranch... we'll wait. Ok, we won't wait long... these flatbreads highlight both those flavors and then some, with peppery arugula and cheese.", "Caesar salad is one of the best salads out there, but salad for dinner? It's just not enough. You'll be hungry an hour later! You won't be hungry with this meal, that scrumptious garlicky good flavor covering a succulent chicken breast. The crunchy croutons on top raise it from good to perfection.", "Gyros… as the Greek gods on Mt. Olympus intended. (What came first, the gyros or the gods? Question for the ages.) Tender pork, cooked with seasoning and tomatoes, and topped with a bit of light heat with a pepperconi and cucumber crema. These gyros are so good, Zeus would have turned himself into a Home Chef customer for 'em.", "Yo-de-lay, yo-de-lay, yo-de-lay, yo-de-lay eee ooo! That may not be how any of that is spelled, but this sandwich makes us dream we're in the Alps, in a tiny café, with this meaty delicious sandwich and tangy potato salad on the side. We love the mountain life.", "Top your pork chop with nothing but the best: tangy roasted tomato, Asiago, and nutty almonds bring out the best in the meaty chops. Fresh broccoli on the side, with onion and garlic pepper, with sweet balsamic, also give the pork chop an assist. (Not that it needs it; pork chops are tops! Ah, poetry.)", "Yup, what you're looking at right here is a breadless banh mi; all the flavors you love in that classic Vietnamese sandwich, in bowl form. Will the wonders ever cease? Ground pork, flavored with ginger and teriyaki, join pickled cucumbers and carrots in topping fragrant jasmine rice. It's exactly like the sandwich, except, dare we say, even better.", "A chili that takes one pot and comes together in less than 15 minutes? With turkey, corn, cheese, tortilla strips, and sour cream, a.k.a. all the fixings'? Yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. Is it a miracle? Nope, just Home Chef stovetop meals.", "Easy to make and delightful to eat, these Acapulco-style pork tacos make dinner a festive occasion. Pork strips, seasoned with taco seasoning, fill tortillas along with zesty slaw. Buen provecho!", "The world is full of amazing cuisines to be inspired by, and Vietnamese cuisine is certainly no slouch on that regard. The amazing noodle bowls known as pho delight and tantalize all around the globe. Here, we've got the noodles, and the succulent pork, the pho flavorings… all coming together in your kitchen.", "Need a quick and good pasta bowl to get your week going? Look no further… (no, don't open a new tab…we said look no further!)… than this meal. Meaty sausage, three cheeses, and zesty roasted red peppers all mix with penne in under fifteen minutes. Go ahead, put it in your basket. (No, don't go to Facebook… no, don't click on that link!)", "Dill and seafood go together like two peas in the pod (there are no peas in this recipe), like peanut butter and jelly (not included in your box), or sour cream and onion… which we have right here, being stirred into creamy mashed potatoes. You know what else goes together? You and this dinner.", "This meal has many amazing, tasty moving parts: succulent chicken, feisty pepper, hearty beans, the slight heat and flavor bounty of chipotle crema, fresh lime (and cilantro lime salt!), and delicious rice. With so much going on, it's amazing it gets distilled into one perfect meal. But amazement is our middle name. (Not Shirley like it says on the old birth certificate.)", "Do you want a restaurant-quality dinner? Don't we all these days. Do you want it in fifteen minutes or less? Look no further than this stunner, with tender pork bathed in a creamy mushroom sauce and garlicky green beans on the side. Quality can come quick, and the best flavors can take no time at all.", "One thing we've learned over the years of providing you with delicious dinners that are easy to make at home: having a meal with both ranch and BBQ sauce is a guaranteed hit. We have the facts, figures, and Excel sheets to prove it. But we've never tried to combine both with the awesome combination of “steak” and “tacos.” These four together might just break our computers, but it'll be worth it to provide you with the flavors you crave. Tip: Easiest way to remove jalapeño stems and seeds: remove ends, then hold upright. Carefully slice the pepper into four pieces, leaving stem and seed to discard."

Okay, maybe not that deep; maybe just the depth of a steak dinner thats actually finished “Moby Dick.” Or a steak dinner with a sauce of deep demi-glace and rich garlic, herb and cheese, enrobing the steak with pure flavor. Deep, man. Tip: if youre looking for the right texture for the sauce, draw a line through the sauce in the pan. If the line lingers, its thickened!",
                "Everything is better with butter. Flaky, light salmon, too; youll cook it to perfection, then top it with a creamy butter made with lemon zest and herbaceous thyme. Butters not the only rich delight; a cheesy creamy gratin fills you up without weighing you down. Better with butter, and butters found its best in this meal.",
                "Tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, and cheesy to boot, this chicken breast will fulfill all your dinner dreams, and maybe a few “leftovers at midnight” ones as well. The creamy, delightful tomato risotto is also the stuff of luxurious lullabies, comforting and filling. (With a bit of fresh broccolini on the side for your health.) Sweet dreams.",
                "This Greek and Mexican mash-up is an exciting collaboration of cultures, but the most exciting part is how it tastes: steak strips with herbaceous seasoning, tangy banana peppers, and fresh tomato, rolled into tortillas and fried to perfection. With tzatziki on top, this meal says both ole and opa, but mostly says oh yes.",
                "Sure, the lobster roll gets all the accolades and love, but, for our money, shrimp is just as tasty without breaking the bank. This baby, with fresh tomato and lettuce, those tasty crustaceans, and a remoulade sauce to die for, is a shrimp sandwich divine, one the angels sing about. This will be your go-to seafood sandwich from now on. Tip: Getting hip to the sticks: making fries is easy! Halve your potato, then place cut side down. Slice lengthwise into 1/2 slices, then stack half the potato slices and cut again to 1/2 slices.",
                "Dress for the job you want, they say, and this chicken dons a puff pastry wrap with the intention of being the most scrumptious dinner of your week. Golden and flaky, the puff provides perfect contrast with the tender and juicy chicken. They both sop up the shallot cream like it’s a calling, not just a way to get a paycheck. We consider this pastry wrapped chicken hired, with the intention to promote. Tip: Line em up! The best way to remove the ends of green beans is to line them up evenly, then remove them with one cut.",
                "Home Chef has provided you delicious and easy-to-prepare meals for years, but weve just gotten to getting you some sweet and sour chicken in 2021. Why? Well, it took us that look to perfect it, and we think weve nailed it here. We made it crispy, crunchy, and all around delicious with pineapple to boot. Good things come to those who wait!",
                "Weve put the flavors of French onion on a pizza, on a risotto, and on a chicken… the next stop on this train was obviously a meatloaf. The creamy, cheesy, onion-y topper to these solid ground beef loaves is absolutely fabulous; the bacon Brussels sprouts--the decadent side of decadent sides. Whats next? French onion ravioli? French onion tacos? The skys the limit for our onion-y love.",
                "Tex-Mex taco plus pizza? Yes please. Do we need to say more? Crispy dough, meaty ground beef, with tomatoes, and topped with cheese, lettuce, and sour cream… look at that picture above these words and see. What more can we say? Put this in our box (and mouths) please!",
                "Crushed crispy onions and cheese coat these medallions with something special. We say something special a lot, but the combination of the crispy, the soft, the salty, the rich, and the sweet take this meal to new and, ahem, special places. We balance that heavy yumminess with a fresh salad on the side. Something special, that were proud to share with you.",
                "Summer may still be here, but the colder air of fall is on its way, and with it the comfort food that gets us all through. This risotto brings a toasty delight, for those evenings where the chill is just too much. Candied walnuts and butternut squash topping creamy richness reminds us that sweeter days are yet to come.",
                "Sushi may immediately bring visions of raw fish and slabs of wasabi, but there are other flavors to celebrate beyond the obvious. Tofu seared in sweet teriyaki joins cucumbers and carrots doused in seasoned rice vinegar, as well as avocado and spicy Sriracha mayo. Topped with sesame seeds, this is just the bowl to complete your sushi flavor education.",
                "“Everything-crusted?” Do we mean crusted with seasoning, basketball hoops, ruby necklaces, camera film, and all the contents of the universe, including black matter and quarks? Well, ok… we dont mean everything “everything.” We mean the salty seasoned perfection of the everything bagel seasoning, dusting the tuna with texture and contrast and everything good. “Everything” good? Here we go again…",
                "Lets hear it for the patriotic pecan. Thomas Jefferson planted pecans at Monticello. (He called them “Illinois nuts,” which gives us at Home Chef HQ in Chicago a bit of pride.) He gave the seeds to George Washington, who planted some pecans at Mt. Vernon. Now ask, what have pistachios or walnuts done lately to show their love of the USA? The pecan is number one in this meal as well, partnering with goat cheese to top those sweet sweet potatoes with something special. USA! USA! Tip: Having trouble cutting that wobbly sweet potato? Trim off 1/4 along its length and cut that section into 1/2 dice. Turn sweet potato onto its flat side. You now have a flat base to work from while you dice remaining sweet potato.",
                "You love coating a juicy, succulent chicken with creamy, salty, rich cheese… but have you tried stuffing the chicken with said creamy, salty, rich cheese? No? You can rectify that with this meal, where cheese and poblano end up inside the chicken. With the slight heat of a chipotle lime crema on top, this stuffed chicken proves that inside is just as good as outside. Tip: Easier way to mince cilantro? Gather them all in one hand and lay on the cutting board. Use your knife in a rocking motion to cut, then turn 90 degrees and repeat until the herbs are properly minced!",
                "We want to put tzatziki everywhere: on gyros, of course, but on tacos, on flatbreads, and even in our coffee. (What? Its creamy!) Its great on a steak too, the cooling cucumber sauce matching with the tender meat like it was born to. Tzatziki for the win! Dont have a box grater or its in the dishwasher? Worry not! Just trim and then mince the cucumber as small as you can.",
                "This meal looks like its all about the health at first: fresh green beans and flaky salmon arent exactly a cheeseburger and fries. (But, oh, if a cheeseburger and fries was as healthy as green beans and salmon!) But first glances dont always tell the whole story: the second word of the title is where the fun begins. Salty rich pecans and our friend butter combine to top the salmon with some lovely decadence. Combining healthy and fun never tasted so good! Tip: Line em up! The best way to remove the ends of green beans is to line them up evenly, then remove them with one cut.",
                "This meal is all about the jang: Gochujang is a popular Korean condiment thats gained popularity in the US over the last few years. Its both sweet and spicy, made of chili powder, rice, and soy, and fermented over years in traditional clay pots, placed on platforms out-of-doors. The jang in the aioli adds a delightful smoky spice to the chicken, with the crunchy wontons adding the crunch. Gochujang is here to stay, and after you try this meal, youll see why.",
                "Crispy chicken sandwich is all the rage, but thats not the only chicken sandwich out there. The combination of stretchy, melty cheese and an aioli made of pungent garlic and delicious, delicious bacon are just as good as anything fried. Potatoes coated with herbs make for the perfect side. Ignore the fads; deliciousness is beyond trends.",
                "These wraps combine a whole bevy of great flavor profiles: ground pork, all savory and delicious, is cooked with a bit of pungent ginger and sweet oranges. Crunchy slaw sits on top, adding both freshness and texture. The combinations here will send your taste buds soaring, an amazing feat for a weeknight meal.",
                "Textural contrast may sound like something you study in college, not feel and sense in a meal. (“The Great Gatsby has great textural contrast with the green light at the end of the pier.” Kids, dont put that in your college essays.) Tilapia is soft, a light fish, crumbly good, and the panko covering it gives it a great crunch, allowing your mouth to feel both at the same time. Gatsbys not the good guy (youre welcome, kids), but textural contrast here is better than good: its great."

                "Sauce Normandy, or Normande, is a classic seafood sauce, with cream, butter, fish stock, maybe some wine, maybe some spices. (Sauces, like gymnasts, are flexible!) Here, weve got some cream and umami mushroom seasoning combining to coat this flaky soft mahi-mahi with something truly special. (That mahi-mahi itself is pressed with garlic and herbs, adding bold flavor.) However you spell it, this sauce is truly yummy (or yumme).",
                "Sweet fig and salty bacon come together like two lovers taking a stroll by a river on a warm May day. (Creative writing class A+ work here!) Theyre strong flavors, and they do great work here with this chicken. But they arent the only heavy hitters here: is there anything that reads strong flavors more than blue cheese fondue? The fondue turns the green beans into something really special, like two lovers taking a stroll by a river on a warm M--- oh, maybe our story-telling needs a bit of work.",
                "Da Vinci, Amerigo Vespucci, Machiavelli, this pork chop… all hail from the region of Italy known as Tuscany. (Well, not the piggy… that we dont know.) The inspiration for this dish hails from Tuscany, sunny and dotted with sunflowers. Brightness abounds, with a tomato-y Parmesan sauce, with a hint of spice making the perfect adornment for the tender and lean pork chop. The cauliflower scampi brings the divine decadence, just as Da Vinci would have drawn. (Well… he didnt draw many vegetables.) Altogether, this meal brings the Tuscan touch into your evening meal. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole clove with the side of your chefs knife. Then rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over the top.",
                "We all love some sauce for our loaf, but sweet BBQ is not the only sauce that coats the loaves with such deliciousness. Mushroom cream sauce brings out richness and umami delight, and the hints of wine and onion adding notions of sharpness. All the complexity of the flavor, but yet very easy to make. In other words, a classic Home Chef meal.",
                "The drums are beating out a unique pattern, the bass is groovin on a line of its own, and guitars are being strummed and/or plucked to match… this band is jammin. Music has a harmony of its own and so does food; the jam here takes your plain, workaday onion and transforms it into tangy, sweet delight, perfect for the Brussels sprouts. And thats not the only magical chord in this dinner: the creamy red pepper sauce plays a solo that both rocks and shreds on the succulent chicken. This meal is the best kind of sunshine daydream. Tip: If youre looking for the right texture for the sauce, dip a spoon in and see how well it sticks to the back. If it coats, youre good to go.",
                "Dijon harkens back to middle ages, first appearing at the table of King Philip VI. It didnt get popular, though, until the 19th century when a guy living in, you guessed It, Dijon, replaced vinegar with verjuice -unripe grapes acidic juice. That unripe grape acidic juice brings its strong flavor to this tilapia, both in coating and in sauce. The deliciousness is rounded out by a ratatouille on the side.",
                "Those classic umami-bombs, the mighty mighty mushrooms, make for an aces starting point to a rich, delicious gravy, with just a hint of spice to make things exciting and, well, spicy. But mushrooms arent the only ingredients with a claim to mighty: tender pork chops, rich, succulent, and magnificently meaty, make their marriage with mushroom gravy into marvelous mealtime merriment. (That may not be our alliteration record, but its close.)",
                "Is this meal just good? No, its Gouda… and by Gouda, we mean rich, salty, yummy cheese that helps forms a sauce that enrobes the crispy tortillas with pure flavor gold. And with meaty, umami-rich portobello mushrooms (and cream cheese) on the inside, these flautas arent just good, arent just Gouda, theyre great… a. (We tried too hard with that one, we know.)",
                "Cheesy… its the saccharine moments at the end of old sitcoms, where lessons were learned and hugs exchanged. Cheesy is the greeting card your aunt sent you for graduation. Cheesy is dad jokes. Cheesy is also this delectable dinner, with a cauliflower gratin made of cream cheese and nutty, salty Parmesan. Cheesy is also this chicken, crusted in the light tang of gorgeous goat cheese. Cheesy… its whats for dinner.",
                "Maine is known for two things primarily: Stephen King and lobsters. (Well, and once being part of Massachusetts, but no need to bring that up.) This sandwich is inspired by the one of the best ways to eat a Maine lobster around: the amazing roll. Crunchy celery, herbaceous dill, creamy mayo, and our tiny little buddies shrimp combine to top the toasted buns with everything you need for a tasty bite. Dont bury things in a pet cemetery, and dont skip out on this meal.",
                "We know everybody loves French onion soup, so we figured out a way to incorporate those flavors into a delicious chicken dinner. Caramelized onions and Swiss cheese top a beautifully seared chicken breast before being melted to perfection in the oven. Tip: Easy way to remove thyme from stem: just pinch the top and run your fingers down the stem. Presto! The leaves should just fall off.",
                "The title of the meal may sound like one of those shows, we cant say which one, where chefs are given a bushel of ingredients and some minutes to come up with something fabulous. Rhymes with “Mouse Punters.” (Whoops, wrong show.) Anyway, this isnt some random basket with raspberry, turkey, and chipotle. Our chefs know their flavors: tender turkey, slightly sweet, slightly tart raspberry, and smoky chipotle combine for sublime taste bud nirvana. And now youll know what to do if you ever get this group of ingredients when youre on that show that rhymes with “Hop Ref.” Uh…",
                "This meal is for those who want to eat right, but also eat delicious. The fish cakes here are light and flaky, with the salty Parmesan adding just the right note of umami. The remoulade brings sweetness, and the Caesar salad complements with beautiful, nutty crunchiness. This meal has a total tastes great, yet great for you thing happening.",
                "Mamma mia! This brown butter sauce is based on “velouté,” which is one of the five “mother sauces” the French and culinary types are so crazy about. A traditional velouté is a stock (made from the bones of the animal) mixed with a roux, flour, and butter. We hue very close to tradition here, giving you a sauce of chicken base, flour, and butter, to adorn the chicken with, bringing a “velvety” touch to the succulent bird. After making yourself this meal, youll be able to say youve got one out of five mother sauces down!",
                "Soft isnt just for tissues and pillows; soft and creamy are the hallmarks of a great risotto, as well as delicious, rich, and filling. We deck those hallmarks with garlic and Parmesan, an out-of-season pun, but a proper pungent possession of this creamy risotto. The soft here is topped by an even better soft, in the tender morsels of scallop augmented by nutty Parmesan and bright lemon. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole clove with the side of your chefs knife. Then rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over the top.",
                "“Pe-can, pe-can, pe-can pie,” Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal famously repeated in When Harry Met Sally, and while we dont have any pie to offer you (we wish!), we do have pecans. Specifically, we have a pecan-parsley-Dijon-crusted chicken breast that offers rich, vivid flavor in every bite. We also have carrots flavored with BBQ spice and butter, pairing perfectly with the chicken. This dish will have all your friends and neighbors telling you theyd be proud to partake in your pecan chicken. Tip: Want an easy way to mince parsley? Gather the stems in one hand, and lay the leaves on the cutting board. Cut leaves with your knife using a rocking motion, then turn 90 degrees and repeat until the parsley is minced.",
                "So maybe your stuffed pepper experience is limited to a few microwave meals or jalapeño poppers at your local wing place. No time like the present to expand your packed pepper preferences. These poblanos are stuffed with seasoned pork and corn and topped with cheese and cilantro. Delicious and easy-to-make, youll be calling yourself a stuffed pepper connoisseur after cleaning your plate. Tip: Easier way to mince cilantro? Gather them all in one hand and lay on the cutting board. Use your knife in rocking motion to cut, then turn 90 degrees and repeat until the herbs are properly minced!",
                "Snack food, bar food, served piping hot with spicy mustard at the ball game… pretzels are everywhere with their crunchy, salty goodness. But that crunch and the salt can do one better than just being paired with beer and baseball; here, we coat a succulent, juicy pork chop with pretzel perfection. And just to keep in the familiar, we give you a Dijon mayo for a seriously yummy flavor pairing. Youll never look down on snack food again.",
                "There are all kinds of chowder, from corn to chicken to clam… we swear, there are chowders that dont have c names. Like this one, where salty, crispy, bacon-esque prosciutto is the star of the show. Potatoes, peas, and garlic prevent prosciutto from stealing the scene too much; this subtle, creamy chowder will have you leaving the “c”s behind for the perfection of the “p”s. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole clove with the side of your chefs knife. Then rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over the top.",
                "Did you grow up hearing the pun “you can tune a piano, but you cant tune a fish?” Did it make you think of a fish playing the piano? Just us? Well, you can play some Rachmaninoff on your phone while you sear up this meaty tuna steak, getting it to that seared-outside-pink-inside that is pure perfection. And with a panko coating, the tenderness inside will be extra juicy and the contrast extra lovely. Cant tuna fish? Yes we can.",
                "Have you ever had your zucchini… in noodle form? Have we blown your mind? Rocked your world? Vaguely amused you as you changed tabs to check your email? Well, theyre called zoodles, and they cant be beaten, for they give you your green vegetables in a way thats exciting and new. Cooked with acidic tomatoes, nutty Parmesan, and pungent garlic, theyll be your new veggie go-to. You may now go back to your emails. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole clove with the side of your chefs knife. Then rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over the top.",

While salmon roasts, make lemon piccata butter. | Combine capers, softened butter, and ½ tsp. lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Set aside. | Return pan used to sear salmon to medium heat and add 2 tsp. olive oil. Add tomatoes, garlic, ¼ tsp. salt, and ¼ cup water to hot pan. Bring to a simmer. Once simmering, stir occasionally until liquid is reduced by half, 2-3 minutes. Stir in zucchini ribbons and ¼ tsp. salt. Then stir occasionally until tender, 2-3 minutes. Dont worry if ribbons break while cooking; theyll still be delicious! Remove from burner and stir in half the cheese (reserve remaining for garnish). | Plate dish as pictured on front of card, topping salmon with lemon piccata butter, and zucchini ribbons with remaining cheese and croutons. Squeeze lemon wedges over zucchini to taste. Bon appétit!"
